## QUICK ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION

**"Create a REALISTIC implementation workflow for creating the 12 images"**

**The realistic answer**:
- **6 images** can be done in **1 week** (10 hours) with NO blockers
- **9 images** can be done in **2 weeks** (17 hours) with NO blockers
- **11 images** need **3 weeks** (27 hours) with employer approval
- **12th image** is optional/undefined

**Main blocker**: Employer approval for 2 proprietary project images (APEX ML, Acoustic Vision)

**Recommendation**: Deploy with 6 images in Week 1, enhance incrementally

## CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES & BLOCKERS

### BLOCKER 1: Employer Approval (Affects 2 images)
**Images**: APEX ML architecture, Acoustic Vision concept
**Timeline**: 1-3 weeks wait time
**Mitigation**:
- Send approval request immediately (Day 0)
- Proceed with other 9 images while waiting
- Use generic placeholders if denied
- Or omit proprietary projects entirely

**Email template provided in IMAGE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md**

### BLOCKER 2: Paper Access (Affects 3-4 images)
**Images**: Thermal calibration, Respiration, Multi-view
**Papers needed**:
- Springer 2024 (likely have access as author)
- SENSORS 2020 (MDPI open access, should be free)
- KAIS 2021 / ICROS 2020 (domestic, may need library)

**Mitigation**:
- Download from publisher (author access)
- Use ResearchGate preprints
- Contact co-author (Prof. Lee) for copies
- Regenerate from thesis data if needed

### BLOCKER 3: Data Access (Affects 2-4 images)
**Images**: Seismic detection, possibly depth camera
**Data needed**:
- Seismic data from UMD project (2023)
- Depth camera data from NRF project (2020-2022)

**Mitigation**:
- Use provided Python script (generates synthetic data)
- Use public datasets (USGS seismic, NYU depth)
- Request data from former colleagues (if allowed)

---

## RISK LEVELS

### LOW RISK (7 images, 8 hours)
Can complete with high confidence, no approvals needed:
- Profile photo
- Thermal calibration before/after
- Respiration signal
- Seismic before/after (using script)

### MEDIUM RISK (2 images, 5 hours)
May encounter data/tool challenges:
- Depth camera before/after
- Multi-view calibration

### HIGH RISK (2 images, 15 hours)
Blocked by employer approval:
- APEX ML architecture
- Acoustic Vision concept

---

## TIME ESTIMATES (Realistic Scenarios)

### Optimistic (Everything goes smoothly)
- All data/papers accessible
- Approval received quickly
- No design iterations needed
- **Total**: 15-20 hours over 2 weeks

### Realistic (Normal development)
- Some data access issues (use fallbacks)
- Approval takes 2 weeks
- 2-3 design iterations
- **Total**: 25-30 hours over 3 weeks

### Pessimistic (Roadblocks hit)
- Need to regenerate most data
- Approval takes 4 weeks or denied
- Learning curve for design tools
- **Total**: 35-40 hours over 4-5 weeks

**Most likely**: Realistic scenario (27 hours, 3 weeks)

---

## TOOLS REQUIRED

### Free & Required
- **Python** + matplotlib, numpy, scipy, opencv (for auto-generation)
- **remove.bg** (background removal for profile photo)
- **PDF reader** (to access papers)
- **Image editor** (GIMP, Paint.NET, Photopea - for cropping/resizing)

### Free & Recommended

## KEY INSIGHTS FROM ANALYSIS

### 1. Employer Approval is the Critical Path
- Affects 2 images (APEX ML, Acoustic Vision)
- Can't proceed without it
- **Action**: Request immediately

### 2. Most Images are Low-Risk
- 7 out of 11 images have NO approval requirements
- Can be completed in Week 1-2
- **Action**: Start with these

### 3. Auto-Generation Saves Significant Time
- 4 images can be generated with one Python script
- High quality, publication-ready
- **Action**: Run script early

### 4. Paper Extraction is Easiest
- 3-4 images from existing published papers
- Just download, screenshot, crop
- **Action**: Prioritize these

### 5. Manual Design is Most Time-Intensive
- 2 images require creative design
- 15 hours combined
- **Action**: Consider hiring designer ($40-100) to save 10-15 hours

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Kim Ju O Specifically

**Given your situation** (industry researcher, recent graduate, 2 SCI papers, proprietary projects):

1. **Start with MVP approach**
   - Week 1: 6 images (no approvals needed)
   - Deploy working website immediately
   - Build momentum with early success

2. **Request approval ASAP**
   - Don't wait - send email today
   - This is the longest wait time
   - Can work on other images meanwhile

3. **Use the Python script**
   - You have strong Python skills ✓
   - Auto-generates 4 images in minutes
   - High quality, no manual work

4. **Extract from papers first**
   - You're the author - have access ✓
   - Easiest, fastest method
   - Professional quality guaranteed

5. **Consider designer for complex diagrams**
   - If design isn't your strength
   - $30-50 on Fiverr saves 10-15 hours
   - Frees you to focus on technical work

6. **Deploy incrementally**
   - Don't wait for all 11 images
   - Week 1 MVP is impressive enough
   - Enhance over time

---

## REALITY CHECK

**Your question**: "Create a REALISTIC implementation workflow"

**Realistic answer**:
- ✓ You CAN create all 11 images
- ✓ You WILL encounter some blockers (approval, data access)
- ✓ You DON'T need all 11 to launch
- ✓ 6 images in 10 hours is VERY achievable
- ✓ 27 hours over 3 weeks is REALISTIC and DOABLE

**Most realistic outcome**:
- Week 1: Create 6 images, deploy MVP
- Week 2: Create 3 more images, enhance deployment
- Week 3: Wait for approval
  - If approved: Add 2 final images (complete!)
  - If denied: Launch with 9 images (still excellent!)

**Bottom line**: You'll have a professional portfolio live in 1 week, enhanced in 2-3 weeks.
