Kim Ju O is a Lead Researcher at JS SYSTEM's R&D Division, where he develops distributed AutoML platforms and AI-powered acoustic vision systems. He received his Master of Engineering in Computer Engineering (AI) from Keimyung University in 2025, where he was advised by Prof. Deok-Woo Lee. His thesis focused on deep learning-based abnormal respiration signal detection using ultra-wideband radar sensors.

His research interests include signal processing, sensor fusion, computer vision, and deep learning, with emphasis on extracting patterns from multi-modal sensor data such as radar, thermal imaging, and acoustic signals. He has conducted international research at the University of Maryland Physics Department, working on superconducting seismic wave detection systems with 40% SNR improvement. His publications have appeared in the Journal of Signal Processing Systems (Springer, 2024) and SENSORS (MDPI, 2020). His work bridges fundamental signal processing research with scalable AI systems for real-world applications.
